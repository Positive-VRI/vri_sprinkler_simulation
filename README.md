#### Copyright (C) 2022 Dario Lodi Rizzini, Gabriele Penzotti.


OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------

VRI Sprinkler Simulation is a collection of Octave scripts for simulation 
the variable rate irrigation (VRI) performed by hose reel rain gun sprinkler 
in agriculture. 
This application has been developed as part of the activities of the [POSITIVE](http://www.progettopositive.it/) 
collaborative project (European Regional Development Fund POR-FESR 2014-2020, 
Research and Innovation of the Region Emilia-Romagna).    

More information is provided in the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4352021):

DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------------

The provided scripts are written in the programming language Octave 
for scientific computing and can be executed with the homonymous software application Octave.
The scripts should also be compatible with Matlab, but they have never been tested. 


QUICK START
-------------------------------------------------

Let ${vri_sprinkler_simulation_DIR} be the install directory of your local copy 
of vri_sprinkler_simulation. 

Open Octave application and use the command window to run the following commands.

-  cd ${vri_sprinkler_simulation_DIR}/scripts
-  simulate_acquacampus_20210826

You will see the output of simulation.
